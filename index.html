</p> To my dear Felon Kaya Marie Cardoza, </p> 
I know this is kinda funky maybe even a weird idea, but I wanted to make this because it was my second best idea for a physical thing, so this little letter I wanted to make was to tell you how much you mean to me and have meant for many years now. Not once have I not been happy seeing your text pop up, regardless if we are upset, annoyed, or whatever at each other. You are by far, without a doubt, my favorite notification on my phone for the longest time. You really are the person I love talking to all day everyday even when I'm busy or whatever. You've truly been a blessing in my life, all the laughs, joy, and smiles you've brought to me, I have never forgotten. You've been the girl I can never forget and someone I care so much about. You've made me want to become a better man, learn more about you, and listen to you all the time, whether we are on the phone or texting. I could never get tired of talking or listening to you, and I will never get tired of it. I know we've had rough times recently, but you make me want to try more and more to be better because you're the one I want to have and keep in my life. You are sunshine to me, getting to talk to you all the time is my favorite part of the day and something I look forward to all the time. You are such a special person to me and I could not imagine what it would be like if we never met. But one thing is for sure, I'm soooooo thankful, grateful, and happy and ever more so, to have been lucky enough to meet you and since then, you've become my favorite person. Regardless of everything we've been through, you've been the girl who's always stayed on my mind and even if you think otherwise, it's the truth. I don't have enough words to tell you what you mean to me, you're the girl I love to hear, text, play with, talk about whatever random things come up, talk late at night and I genuinely never ever get tired of you. I know I'm dumb sometimes or all the time according to you (jk) especially recently, mistakes I've made and deeply regretted but you have taught me so many things throughout these years that I haven't forgotten and try every day to be less dumb and to keep my promise to be a better man. Without you I wouldn't have been able to figure things out or improve things in my own life. Your resilience, kindness, care, and hard work are some things I admire so much about you. You motivate me in ways you don't even know, all the little things I notice or remember about you make me want to work harder. Although it's difficult sometimes, thank you for all your effort in communicating stuff with me, you have no idea how much it means to me. The way you have tried and opened up more to me means the world to me because I know it can be hard sometimes, and it makes me so happy. My admiration towards everything you do and have accomplished makes me happy knowing what an amazing girl you are after how hard life can be. Thank you for everything, I'm grateful to still be talking to you and have loved every moment we've spent playing or just talking together. One thing is for sure, you have and will always have a special place in heart because you've been someone that has meant the world to me and I could never forget, I could never hate, I could never be annoyed, I could never replace, and I could never imagine a world without you. As much as you may or may not believe me, you've been the only girl on my mind even when we have gone a few hours to months without talking. Ever since we met, it's been like that, and when we didn't talk it was like a bit to look for you on my phone, and yes it was hard for me sometimes but not once did I forget about you. I know you may think those things sometimes but the truth is, you're the girl I haven't forgotten about, the girl I want to be better for, the girl who I will never get tired of, the girl who I want to be in my future, its hard for me to put into words sometimes but you truly are my person. I always think about the olive and pickle theory you told me about because even tho we are opposites in somethings, something about you is just so, like, woah, and I will never get over you. Before this gets too long cause idk if it'll fit on the page, all I want you to know is that no matter what you'll always be the girl I love talking to, even from the start, I could tell you had the sweetest soul and that curiosity I had, made me wan to talk to you, your eyebrows I'll never forget. I will never regret the effort I put into talking to you that first time. I know we have our ups and downs, but the love, care, and admiration I have for you so much greater than those, I wish you could see yourself through my eyes so you can truly see what I mean, you're everything, the way you are, your laugh, your voice, your craziness (in a good way), your smile, your toxicaness, just everything that I can't get enough of you. But in the end for now, thank you for being you, thank you for being here, thank you so much because you'll always be the best felon ever.
<p> P.S. I hope you like it and I debated A LOT sending it to you cause its probably cheesy but idc I prob will anyway but maybe after you fall asleep or not cause idk what you'll think but Im not sure LMAO but all jokes aside, from the first sentence, I really mean everything, you mean so much to me, more than you could imagine and all I can do is tell you, and I will and try to show you as much as I can and because you deserve to know.</p>
